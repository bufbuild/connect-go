	// The zero code is OK, which indicates that the operation was a success. We
	// don't define a constant for it because it overlaps awkwardly with Go's
	// error semantics: what does it mean to have a non-nil error with an OK
	// status?

	// CodeCanceled indicates that the operation was canceled, typically by the
	// caller.
	//
	// Note that connect follows the gRPC specification (and some, but not all,
	// implementations) and uses the British "CANCELLED" as CodeCanceled's string
	// representation rather than the American "CANCELED".
	CodeCanceled Code = 1

	// CodeUnknown indicates that the operation failed for an unknown reason.
	CodeUnknown Code = 2

	// CodeInvalidArgument indicates that client supplied an invalid argument.
	//
	// Note that this differs from CodeFailedPrecondition: CodeInvalidArgument
	// indicates that the argument(s) are problematic regardless of the state of
	// the system (for example, an invalid URL).
	CodeInvalidArgument Code = 3

	// CodeDeadlineExceeded indicates that deadline expired before the operation
	// could complete. For operations that change the state of the system, this
	// error may be returned even if the operation has completed successfully
	// (but late).
	CodeDeadlineExceeded Code = 4

	// CodeNotFound indicates that some requested entity (for example, a file or
	// directory) was not found.
	//
	// If an operation is denied for an entire class of users, such as gradual
	// feature rollout or an undocumented allowlist, CodeNotFound may be used. If
	// a request is denied for some users within a class of users, such as
	// user-based access control, CodePermissionDenied must be used.
	CodeNotFound Code = 5

	// CodeAlreadyExists indicates that client attempted to create an entity (for
	// example, a file or directory) that already exists.
	CodeAlreadyExists Code = 6

	// CodePermissionDenied indicates that the caller does'nt have permission to
	// execute the specified operation.
	//
	// CodePermissionDenied must not be used for rejections caused by exhausting
	// some resource (use CodeResourceExhausted instead). CodePermissionDenied
	// must not be used if the caller can't be identified (use
	// CodeUnauthenticated instead). This error code doesn't imply that the
	// request is valid, the requested entity exists, or other preconditions are
	// satisfied.
	CodePermissionDenied Code = 7

	// CodeResourceExhausted indicates that some resource has been exhausted. For
	// example, a per-user quota may be exhausted or the entire file system may
	// be full.
	CodeResourceExhausted Code = 8

	// CodeFailedPrecondition indicates that the system is not in a state
	// required for the operation's execution.
	//
	// Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide between
	// CodeFailedPrecondition, CodeAborted, and CodeUnavailable:
	//
	//   - Use CodeUnavailable if the client can retry just the failing call.
	//   - Use CodeAborted if the client should retry at a higher level. For
	//   example, if a client-specified test-and-set fails, the client should
	//   restart the whole read-modify-write sequence.
	//   - Use CodeFailedPrecondition if the client should not retry until the
	//   system state has been explicitly fixed. For example, a deleting a
	//   directory on the filesystem might return CodeFailedPrecondition if the
	//   directory still contains files, since the client should not retry unless
	//   they first delete the offending files.
	CodeFailedPrecondition Code = 9

	// CodeAborted indicates that operation was aborted by the system, usually
	// because of a concurrency issue such as a sequencer check failure or
	// transaction abort.
	//
	// The documentation for CodeFailedPrecondition includes guidelines for
	// choosing between CodeFailedPrecondition, CodeAborted, and CodeUnavailable.
	CodeAborted Code = 10

	// CodeOutOfRange indicates that the operation was attempted past the valid
	// range (for example, seeking past end-of-file).
	//
	// Unlike CodeInvalidArgument, this error indicates a problem that may be
	// fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file system will
	// generate CodeInvalidArgument if asked to read at an offset that is not in
	// the range [0,2^32), but it will generate CodeOutOfRange if asked to read
	// from an offset past the current file size.
	//
	// CodeOutOfRange naturally overlaps with CodeFailedPrecondition. Where
	// possible, use the more specific CodeOutOfRange so that callers who are
	// iterating through a space can easily detect when they're done.
	CodeOutOfRange Code = 11

	// CodeUnimplemented indicates that the operation isn't implemented,
	// supported, or enabled in this service.
	CodeUnimplemented Code = 12

	// CodeInternal indicates that some invariants expected by the underlying
	// system have been broken. This code is reserved for serious errors.
	CodeInternal Code = 13

	// CodeUnavailable indicates that the service is currently unavailable. This
	// is usually temporary, so clients can back off and retry idempotent
	// operations.
	CodeUnavailable Code = 14

	// CodeDataLoss indicates that the operation has resulted in unrecoverable
	// data loss or corruption.
	CodeDataLoss Code = 15

	// authentication credentials for the operation.
