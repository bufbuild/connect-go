// A Protocol defines the HTTP semantics to use when sending and receiving
// messages. It ties together codecs, compressors, and net/http to produce
// Senders and Receivers.
//
// For example, connect supports the gRPC protocol using this abstraction. Among
// many other things, the protocol implementation is responsible for
// translating timeouts from Go contexts to HTTP and vice versa. For gRPC, it
// converts timeouts to and from strings (for example, 10*time.Second <->
// "10S"), and puts those strings into the "Grpc-Timeout" HTTP header. Other
// protocols might encode durations differently, put them into a different HTTP
// header, or ignore them entirely.
//
// We don't have any short-term plans to export this interface; it's just here
// to separate the protocol-specific portions of connect from the
// protocol-agnostic plumbing.
