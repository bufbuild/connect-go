Connect is a small framework for building HTTP APIs. You write a short API
definition file and implement your application logic, and connect generates
code to handle marshaling, routing, error handling, and content-type
negotiation. It also generates an idiomatic, type-safe client.

Connect is wire-compatible with the [gRPC][grpc] protocol, including streaming.
Connect servers interoperate seamlessly with generated clients in [more than a
dozen languages][grpc-implementations], command-line tools like [grpcurl][],
and proxies like [Envoy][envoy] and [gRPC-Gateway][grpc-gateway].

Under the hood, connect is just [protocol buffers][protobuf] and the standard
library: no custom HTTP implementation, no new name resolution or load
balancing APIs, and no surprises. Everything you already know about `net/http`
still applies, and any package that works with an `http.Server`, `http.Client`,
or `http.Handler` also works with connect.

For more on connect, including a walkthrough and a comparison to alternatives,
see the [docs][].

## A Small Example

Curious what all this looks like in practice? Here's a small h2c server:

```go
package main

import (
  "net/http"

  "golang.org/x/net/http2"
  "golang.org/x/net/http2/h2c"

  // Generated from protobuf schemas.
  pingrpc "github.com/bufconnect/connect/internal/gen/proto/go-connect/connect/ping/v1test"
  pingpb "github.com/bufconnect/connect/internal/gen/proto/go/connect/ping/v1test"
)

type PingServer struct {
  pingrpc.UnimplementedPingServiceHandler // returns errors from all methods
}

func (ps *PingServer) Ping(
  ctx context.Context,
  req *connect.Request[pingpb.PingRequest]) (*connect.Response[pingpb.PingResponse], error) {
  return connect.NewRequest(&pingpb.PingResponse{
    Number: 42,
  }), nil
}

func main() {
  mux, err := connect.NewServeMux(
    pingpb.WithPingServiceHandler(&PingServer{}), // our logic
  )
  if err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }
  http.ListenAndServe(
    ":8081",
    h2c.NewHandler(mux, &http2.Server{}),
  )
}
```

With that server running, you can make requests with any gRPC client.

You can find production-ready examples of [servers][prod-server] and
[clients][prod-client] in the API documentation.

## Status

This is the earliest of early alphas: APIs *will* break before the first stable
release.

## Support and Versioning

Connect supports:

* The [two most recent major releases][go-support-policy] of Go, with a minimum
  of Go 1.18.
* Version 3 of the protocol buffer language ([proto3][]).
* [APIv2][] of protocol buffers in Go (`google.golang.org/protobuf`).

Within those parameters, connect follows semantic versioning.
